# Are anonymous device identifiers personally identifying information (PII)? #

Absolutely. Anonymous device identifiers are personally identifying information.

As with all discussions regarding PII, it is important to understand the difference between personally identifying information (i.e., that can help identify an individual) and personal information (i.e., that can actually identify an individual). Like a driver’s license number, telephone number, or address, a device identifier must be combined with additional information such (e.g., a name) to actually identify an individual.

Generally the greatest risk with PII is not with parties that collect it, but with parties that collect it in addition to other personally identifying information. App developers that use device identifiers to record user preferences and history to improve their app do not know anything beyond how each user uses their app.

However, apps that collect additional personally identifying information (e.g., email address, real name, etc.) and first party platform owners (e.g., Apple , Google, Microsoft, etc.) already have enough information to correlate real identities to devices. Regardless of any technical policies regarding the existence of unique device identifiers, these entities will always have access to users’ personal information.

The privacy question then arises: How do we ensure the security of this personal information? While there is currently no regulation specifically regarding device identification, there is enough precedent with similar PII (e.g., social security, telephone, drivers license, etc.) to establish privacy best practices without removing the ability to identify devices:

  * Notify users when their personal information is being shared with trusted third parties and provide them an opportunity to opt-out.
  * Notify users if a breach of security has taken place and that their personal information may have been compromised.
  * Establish a Do Not Track Registry  so that consumers can opt their devices.
